## Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this exercise was to gather information about temperature trends in Oahu to determine if a surf-and-ice-cream shop business would be sustainable year round. Queries were run for June and December temperature data and a DataFrame was created to calculate summary statistics.

## Results
June Statistics:

December Statistics:

Three key differences in weather between June and December:

- Mean temperature in June is 75F, whereas Decembr mean temperature is 71F.

- June min and max temperatures were 64F and 85F, respectively. December min and max temperatures were 56F and 83F, respectively. 

- The standard deviation in June is 3.26 and in December is 3.75 - a difference of .49 between summer and winter.

## Summary

Since there is very little temperatue variation, the climate of Oahu could easily sustain a surf and ice cream business. It would be beneficial to query precipitation data, as rain could affect the business. In addition, I recommend analyzing several years of historical temperature and rainfall data; a one-year study may be too narrow in scope. A multi-year analysis might demonstrate trends not captured in the current study.
